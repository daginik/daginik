- 👋 Hi, I’m @daginik
- 👀 I’m interested in open source projects, combining open source hardware with software that I can have complete control on
- 🌱 I’m currently learning soldering and making my own boards while uploading my old projects to github privately before finalizing and opening them to public
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bitcoin related open source projects
- 👀 My first objective is to work on library development to automate my writings for organizing, searching, and sorting that I've been lazy to do so manually
- 📫 reach me at d4g1n1k@gmail.com
- ⚡ a skeleton goes into a bar, scooches over to the bartender and goes, "can I have a beer and a mop?"
