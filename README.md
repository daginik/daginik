- 👋 Hi, I’m @daginik
- 👀 I’m interested in building open source projects with open source hardware
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make my own development boards while gradually becoming more active on github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate the most on bitcoin related open source projects
- 👀 One of my first objectives is to work on a library development project to automate my writings for organizing, searching, and sorting that I've been scared to do so manually
